// 1. Create a section for planetary buttons. Fetch the planet data and create a <button> for each of the planets in the json file.

// 2. When a planet button is clicked, populate a section with all the information for that planet except the `is_planet` attribute. 
// ...Use an <img> tag to show the image for that planet. 
// ...Use a <ul> and populate the <ul> with <li>s for each string in the `god_of` section.

// 3. Make sure to clear out the `god_of` section whenever a new planet is clicked and then repopulate that <ul>.

// 4. If the planet is listed as `false` for `is_planet`, make the planet's <img> tag smaller (you can style it to have a smaller width) when setting the <img> tag's other attributes. 
// If it's listed as `true` make the <img> tag larger (you can style it's width again).
